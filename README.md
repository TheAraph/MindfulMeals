## MindfulMeals, a study on Persuasive Technology it's impact on User Experience

In today's world, mobile technologies have become increasingly widespread, seeping into all aspects of our daily lives from communication and entertainment, to shopping and health management. As computers have transitioned from research labs to desktops they have become more persuasive by design. In recent years, there has been a surge in research focusing on technologies that support health behaviour change, known as persuasive technology

The project's primary aim was to examine the influence of persuasive design on user experience through the MindfulMeals mHealth application, to promote healthier habits and combat obesity. The objectives of the study were as follows:
1. Develop a persuasive mHealth application aimed at supporting behaviour
change, with the use of 5 different persuasive strategies.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies in encouraging user engagement
and potential behaviour change.
3. Collect and analyse user feedback and usage data to measure the real-world
impact of the implemented strategies.
4. Study the relationship between persuasive design and user experience.
5. Provide evidence-based recommendations for future mHealth application
developers on how to effectively incorporate persuasive design techniques.


The MindfulMeals app demonstrated the potential of persuasive design in mHealth applications. Key strategies like 'Praise', 'Tailoring', and 'Motivational Prompts' resonated strongly with users, contributing to high user experience scores. Despite the effectiveness of these 3 strategies, 'Rewards' and 'Self-Monitoring' could benefit from adjustments for better user engagement. Interestingly, 'Self-Diverse' notifications were preferred by the majority, enhancing the app's cheerfulness and engagement.
